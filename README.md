# Node Express Example App in conjunction with iOS Swift 2.0 Example App

This is an example node.js express backend api implementation and swift iOS application implementation. 

The xcode application is located in the CycleCash folder, while the node application is located in the cyclecash-api folder. It is using swift 2.0, node v4.4.6 but should work on v5.0.0

The tests use mocha and should. 

This project is intended to provide an example of how node rest API's can work in conjunction with iOS applications. I'm happy to accept contributions that will improve the integrity of this example.
